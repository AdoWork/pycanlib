The tests in this directory is aimed for j1939 support in canlib, covering both kvadblib and kvlclib.

* File contents

Input files:
 - j1939_old_format_sample.dbc :: j1939 dbc file in "old format"
 - j1939_new_format_sample.dbc :: j1939 dbc file in "new format"
 - j1939_test_v5_1.kme50 :: Log file
 - source_frames_v5_1.py :: Frames and expected signal values in kme50

Files used when generating test data (which is done manually when the test should be updated):
 - pduframes.py :: CAN frames to be sent
 - create_log_file.py :: Used to create log file and =source_frames_v5_1.py=


* How to modify the test input

1. Modify the two .dbc files to your liking
2. Modify =pduframes.py= to add/remove/modify what CAN messages that should be recorded into the new kme50 log file.
3. Set =GENERATOR_DEVICE= in =create_log_file.py= to a (minimum) 2 channel device connected to your PC.
4. Setup a Memorator to log everything, that the =GENERATOR_DEVICE= sends at 250k bitrate.
5. Start logging with the Memorator (apply CAN power, remove USB power).
6. Run =python create_log_file.py=
7. Stop logging, connect Memorator to PC and replace =j1939_test_v5_1.kme50= with new log file
8. Update time_offset in test_j1939_kvlclib.py to match first event in kme50.
9. Check in the two input files, =j1939_test_v5_1.kme50= and =source_frames_v5_1.py= which was generated by =create_log_file.py=.
